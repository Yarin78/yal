# Yarins Algorithm Libraries
Data structures and Algorithms written mostly by me for use in programming competitions.

You may use this code if you wish, but be warned - there are likely lot of bugs! There are many other algorithm libraries out there that are both better structured and with fewer bugs and quirks. For instance, [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) is very nice if you code in C/C++.

## Status

I don't do much programming competition these days, so I'm not actively developing this code. There are occassional updates however since I've not entirely stopped :)

## Languages

As my preferred programming language has shifted over the years, so has these libraries evolved. The state of some of the older code is very dubious; use at your own risk!

### C++

This is the oldest part of the code, dating back to my university days, 2000-2003. Kept for historical reasons only; use [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) instead!


### C#

In my first job I coded exclusively in C#, so naturally I started using it in programming competitions as well. I ported most of my C++ algorithms, and added some more, to C#. I used this between 2003-2010. No longer maintained.

### Java

From 2010 I switched jobs and started to work in Java instead. Again I ported my algorithms to this new language.

### Python

From 2018 I found myself coding more in Python than Java, so I figured I might as well port my code to Python as well.
